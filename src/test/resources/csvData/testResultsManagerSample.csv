After a few seconds, my rearview mirror was filled with the bright blue-white headlights of a truck aggressively tailgating me. I was going 25-30 mph. Suddenly the truck crossed the double yellow line into opposite traffic and pulled up alongside me. When I honked, the tow truck cut in front of me and slammed on their brakes to threaten me into an accident. After a few seconds, the truck proceeded, at 10 mph. I took a photo of the license plate when we reached the red light at Martling/Clove Rd. When we made the right turn onto Clove, the tow truck continued to travel at 10 mph on purpose. There was traffic behind me, so I honked. The truck slammed on brakes again, refusing to move for several seconds. The car behind me chose to use the bike lane/shoulder to go around us. When I tried to do the same, the truck revved its engine and wouldn't let me get past. When we reached the light at Clove/Broadway, the car that was behind me and went around was at the red light. I slowed for the red light, knowing that there's no way I would get around the tow truck without getting into a collision. The tow truck sped past the car in front, cut in front, and then turned off its lights to drive dark. It turns out the truck was also going the same direction I was, on Bard (I was far behind the truck at this point due to waiting to make the left turn on Bard) to Forest. On Forest, the tow truck driver narrowly missed hitting a pedestrian and quickly took the right turn onto Metropolitan Ave. The truck is red, and I didn't catch the name of the company that actually owns the truck so I can't complain directly to them. There is a AAA logo across the rear window as well, so I'm issuing a complaint to them as well for this driver's conduct. It was dangerous and absolutely uncalled for. I was terrified. The license plate number is 23186TT.

Last November I followed up with a call to 311, since nothing came of the email to Councillor Crawford.  If anything, a year later, the situation seems worse. Could it be some sort of plot from the Ford government to literally do away with cyclists?! Between Faircroft Blvd. and where Kingston Road splits off to Danforth Ave. I estimate about 40 of 80 sewer grates are wrong heading westbound and about 15 of them are wrong going the other way back home. I'm actually amazed that some cyclist hasn't yet crashed head over heels and then been run over by the pushing-80-kmph traffic. All it would take is a brief distraction or, as happened to me last year, a grate becomes visible at the last second from under the vehicle in front (I somehow miraculously jumped my front tire over the grate and the rear must have found the strip of metal in between). My photo clearly shows how neatly a bicycle wheel fits into one of the grates, and my tires aren't particularly skinny. There are bicycle clubs that regularly use this stretch of Kingston Road. Most of their tires are probably thinner than mine.""r""n""r""nSomething needs to be done. And not just here, but all over the city, from what I can tell. Someone's going to get killed. I could think of one memo that could go out: """"Remember, when reinstalling a sewer grate after cleaning, the tab lines up with the notch. Tab. Notch. Everyone got that?""""""r""n""r""nThat these sewer grates are like this at all is bad enough.

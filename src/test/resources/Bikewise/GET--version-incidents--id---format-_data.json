{"incident.id":[90,66],"incident.title":["Drainage problems flood, then mud the Wissahickon Bike Trail","Large ridges in roadway"],"incident.description":["Poor drainage along the Wissahickon Bike Trail has been causing the trail to become a water hazard and then, later, a mud bog.  The picture is from several months ago, just after a spring flood.\n\n\nSince the trail was renovated in 2007 with $1.4 million (federal funding), it would seem that there has been little or no maintenance to the bikeway by the city. Vegetation grows out over the path in the summer, and mud and leaves narrow the trail in many sections, dangerously crowding together the mix of cyclists, runners, and walkers. \n\n\nThis drainage problem is another example of the poor design and construction of the renovation, and the lack of maintenance since then. Other sections of the trail are too low and frequently flood, first leaving a pool of water and then leaving a covering of thick mud.  It is located across from Wissahickon Hall (Lincoln Drive and Gypsy Lane).\n\n\nSimilar problems exist on the recently renovated, and also poorly designed and constructed Manayunk Canal path.\n\n\nOther open issues nearby issue are: \nhttp://seeclickfix.com/issues/951783 \nhttps://seeclickfix.com/issues/1074714-fallen-tree-across-wissahickon-bike-trail","Please smooth ridges along road.\n\nIt's particularly bumpy for bicycles.\n"],"incident.address":["Wissahickon Bike Trail Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Oakland CA 94607, Oakland, California"],"incident.occurred_at":[1401825772,1402365829],"incident.updated_at":[1568641236,1568641121],"incident.url":["https://bikewise.org/api/v1/incidents/90","https://bikewise.org/api/v1/incidents/66"],"incident.source.name":["SeeClickFix.com","SeeClickFix.com"],"incident.source.html_url":["https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1105582","https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1115281"],"incident.source.api_url":["https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1105582","https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1115281"],"incident.media.image_url":["https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0020/4640/20140330_Wissy_Bike_Trail_MUD.jpg","https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0020/6405/IMG_20140609_185845.jpg"],"incident.media.image_url_thumb":["https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0020/4640/20140330_Wissy_Bike_Trail_MUD.jpg","https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0020/6405/IMG_20140609_185845.jpg"],"incident.type":["Hazard","Unconfirmed"]}
